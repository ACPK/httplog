= HttpLog

Log outgoing Net::HTTP requests in your favorite ruby logger.

== Installation

Not yet on rubygems, so get if from here please.

== Usage

  require 'httplog'

Yup, that's it. By default, this will log all Net::HTTP.request calls to $stdout on DEBUG level.

== Configuration

You can set a different logger:

  HttpLog.logger = Rails.logger
    
And change the severity at which requests are logged

  HttpLog.severity = Logger::Severity::INFO
